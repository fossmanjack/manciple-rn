### Staple toggle doesn't create refresh icon in tray until view is reloaded

Potential solution: extraData

### Unmounted React component when swiping row

Not sure why this is happening.  Potential solution -- delete the row first using
the rowMap that SwipeListView generates.  Research this further.

### Accordion allows more than one entry open at a time

Not sure why.  Need to fix this somehow.

### Icon tray not correctly positioned

This is a frustrating thing that I've been working on for hours now.
